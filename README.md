# Housing-Price-Visualization

This project explores multiple aspects of the US housing market, including the intrinsic factors that impact housing prices, state-level variations in housing prices, long-term trends in housing prices from 1975 to 2022, and the intricate relationship between crime rates, population, salaries, and housing prices. To obtain meaningful insights, advanced data visualization techniques were employed, utilizing packages such as Plotly and Altair to create bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, and maps. The findings reveal that, apart from a decrease from 2007 to 2012, housing prices in the US have generally been on an upward trajectory, with states like MA, NY, and DC having notably higher average housing prices. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between housing prices and the average salaries of a state, but the correlation between the housing price index and its population appears to be weak. Furthermore, areas with high crime rates typically experience lower housing prices. Overall, this research provides crucial insights that investors and households can utilize to make informed decisions about the US housing market.
